# The Challenge
# Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.

# Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W,
# without reordering the remaining characters.

# Note: D can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.

# For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"}
# the correct output would be "apple"

# The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
# The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.
# The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.
# Learning objectives
# This question gives you the chance to practice with algorithms and data structures.
# Itâ€™s also a good example of why careful analysis for Big-O performance is often worthwhile
# , as is careful exploration of common and worst-case input conditions.
